## ERD and Database structure

![EDR](/Users/leslie/Desktop/Coder-Assignment/term_2/Xuefeng_Gu_T2A2/docs/EDR.png)



Ruby on Rails database is basing on active record associations, which relay on the relationships between the different models. In every table, There will be pprimary key and forenigner key. This project is using postgreSQL as database manage system. I firstly generate the models woth the commond line ``rails g model Modelname column:datatype`` . After this tep we generate models and set up the realtionship between diffrenet models. At same time, we have created a ``migration`` file which contain the information about strcuture of our tables in the database. Then we run ``rails db:migrate`` to create the``schema`` file, which at same time push the migration file structures into database.

My database focuses on users and vehicles. Users create vehicles, and vehicels used by the users. The user also can create the order over the vehicle_id, which mean **a client make an order on a specific vehicle.** ``Devise gem`` helps in creating users. And thanks to the ``	Rolify gem`` , we give users  two roles options, one is Driver, and another is Traveler. And relaying on ``Pundit gem`` we create policies, give different roles different authorization.

On one hand, a user with Driver role can create only one vehicle, he can also view, edit and delete the vehicle he creates as well. On the other hand, a user with Traveler role can view all the vehicles content, and he can make a booking to which ever vehicles as long as the vehicle does not belong to him.

## Components(abstractions )

- Conditional rendering -- on the index page, under different condition will dispaly different amount of vehicles. Such as , as a driver, it will only show the vehicle belongs to the current log in driver. He can only edit and delete his car . If no user logging in or loged in user is a traveler, he can view all the vehicles content to make a booking. 
- Different authroization with different roles-- a driver can create ,edit and delete the vehicle belongs to him . A travel can not do that. A traveler acan make a booking and cancel the booking as well, but the driver can not do that to his own car after he use the same email changing the role to be a traveler.
